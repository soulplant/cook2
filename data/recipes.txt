1/2 cup red wine
1 tsp caster sugar
250 g lasagne sheet

Heat oil in a heavy-based saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and garlic. Cook, stirring, for 3 minutes or until onion is tender. Add mince.

= One Pan Spanish Chicken =
https://www.lecremedelacrumb.com/one-pan-spanish-chicken-rice/

4 skinless chicken breast
3 tbsp olive oil
1 cup white rice
600 ml chicken stock
1 lemon
parsley (chopped, for garnish)
2 tsp smoked paprika
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp salt
1 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp chili powder
1 tsp coriander
1/4 tsp Italian seasoning

In a small bowl whisk together all ingredients for the Spanish seasoning mix. Divide in half and set aside. Cut the lemon in half, then thinly slice one half - for garnish - and reserve the other half for juicing later in the recipe.

Place chicken in a medium bowl. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons oil, then toss to coat well. Use half of the prepared seasoning mix to rub on both sides of each piece of chicken.

Drizzle a large skillet with remaining 1 tablespoon of oil and bring to medium heat. Cook chicken for 2-3 minutes on each side until browned. Transfer to a plate. (It won't be cooked through at this point)

Add rice, chicken broth, juice from 1/2 of the lemon, and remaining seasoning mix and stir to combine. Return chicken to the pan on top of the rice. Cover and cook for 20-25 minutes until liquid is absorbed, rice is tender, and chicken is cooked through.

Garnish with lemon slices and freshly chopped cilantro or parsley and serve immediately.
